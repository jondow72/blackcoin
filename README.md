**NOTE:**

The Blackcoin original client is a stable wallet that can be used on various platforms. It is based on the BTC 0.9+ code, but will not be updated. 
You can download the binaries from the https://blackcoin.org website, but has difficulties connecting and syncing with the network.
We advice you to compile the binaries yourself from the current master branch. The connectivity issues have been solved on that branch   

If you need to sync from scratch it can take a long time, and we advice you to use a bootstrap file. 

If you want to use a client based on the newer BTC 0.13 code, you can download the Blackcoin More Client.
